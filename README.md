# biomtokrona
script to convert qiime2 or kraken biom file into krona html5 graph

Step 1 - make it executable "chmod +x biomtokrona"
Step 2 - script takes in biom table as input

ps. I'm getting an error due to qiime2 for some reason so i added the first to line to correct it. If you don't need it, rm it.
